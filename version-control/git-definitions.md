# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? Why is it useful? Version control allows code to be updated and tested without risking the original code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is is a copy of the original code where the changes occur and are tested. What happens in the branch has no affect on the original code (master branch).

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is the command given to save any changes that have been made to a given file.

* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when multiple branches try to change the same code in the the same file in different ways.
